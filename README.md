# NotePal
### Description
NotePal is a note-sharing application for UTD, created and maintained by the Theta Tau Alpha fraternity. Users can *anonymously* upload notes or other materials relevant to their classes by specifying class information (ex. CS 1336 w/ Professor X) and tag(s) that classify the information within the provided notes (ex. Product Rule). Users can also *anonymously* search for notes by class or tag.

Note uploads will be monitored using image-detection ML algorithms to protect the system from explicit or non-relevant images.

### Architecture
The front end is built using React.js, the APIs of the back-end are built using Node.js/Express.js and Flask, the ML model is built using PyTorch (Binary Classification Model using a pre-designed convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database[^\[1\]^](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/efficientnetb0.html) called efficientnet_b0), the image are stored in a "bucket" architecture (similar to an AWS S3 bucket) on the [Box](https://Box.com), and our data is organized in a SQL RDMS called MariaDB (community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL[^\[2\]^](https://www2.computerworld.com.au/article/457551/dead_database_walking_mysql_creator_why_future_belongs_mariadb/)). The application servers are self-hosted and self-run.

### Credits
This project is the idea of Ashar Alvany, developed and expanded on by the NotePal Team at [Theta Tau Alpha](https://www.ttautd.com) (UTD Fraternity). The project's backend relies on an API developed by [UTD's Nebula Labs](https://www.utdnebula.com/). Finally, we are hoping to get the word out using [UTD Mercury](https://utdmercury.com/).

### How to Run
0. Make sure git and node are installed
1. Download the repo
    ```bash
    mkdir NotePal
    git init
    git branch -m main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/ThejasKumar100/NotePal
    git pull origin main
    ```
2. Go to the [Box](https://www.box.com) website and sign in with your UTD email. Create a folder named "NotePal". Open the folder. The folder ID can be found within the URL after the final forward slash. This ID will replace the existing number at back-end/server.js line 274.![alt text](read-me-images/image.png)![alt text](read-me-images/image-1.png)
3. Go to the [Box Developer Console](https://utdallas.app.box.com/developers/console) and create a new custom app (purpose is other and any specification is okay, use User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)). Add your OAuth2.0 Credentials (under the Configuration tab) to the .secrets document. Generate a Developer Token (also under the Configuration tab), and paste it in back-end/server.js at line 66. This token needs to be regenerated every hour.![alt text](read-me-images/image-2.png).
4. Create a file called .secrets in the back-end folder consisting of MariaDB connection info, Box info, and API keys (request this file from the project lead).
5. Run the back-end 
```bash
cd back-end
npm install
node server.js
```
6. Run the front-end
```bash
cd react-front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Current Bugs

- ~~Allows files of any size to be uploaded~~
- ~~When uploading on mobile, the black glass does not extend the entire background of the pop-up~~
- ~~On some mobile browsers, the text of the professor associated with an upload will appear visually cut-off~~
- ~~Inputting a tag and pressing upload without the remainder of upload information (Professor (Optional), course prefix (Mandatory), and course number (Mandatory)) will cause the upload to hang when it should notify to the user that the input is incomplete~~
